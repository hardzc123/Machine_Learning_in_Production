# ARM 
ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) is a family of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures for computer processors.

32-bit or 64-bit instruction set architectures
Energy efficiency and low power consumption

As of 2009, ARM processors accounted for about 90% of all embedded 32-bit RISC processors.

ARM architecture has evolved over time, with versions ranging from ARMv3 to ARMv9, adding features like 64-bit support in ARMv8.

# RISC-V
An open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on RISC principles
